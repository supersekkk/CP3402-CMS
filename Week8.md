## Week
Week 8 (P7) / PHP

## Learning Activities

I hosted a local website using XAMPP, and cloned the directory of the Advice Shop site. I demonstrated echo, decisions, repititions, functions and include with minor changes to the site provided.

## Resources/Links
XAMPP - https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

## Estimated Hours
Figuring how to set up the site took about 30 minutes, and I spent about 1,5 hours with the practical itself

## Content Insights
PHP seems easy to learn and use, with a variety of functions and libraries available. I wasnt too confident about PHP before this, but after playing around with it for a bit, I can absolutely see the appeal and usefulness. It will come in pretty handy for our group project

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I learned that variables starts with $, and in order to break a line in PHP, you need to use "nl2br" after echo, before the string
"Include" is fantastic, as you can reuse the same code across several pages, and save a lot of time and effort. It makes it easier to stay consistent, and it makes for easy maintanence, as you only need to edit once in a single file, which also makes less room for error.
