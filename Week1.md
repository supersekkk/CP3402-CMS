## Week

Week 2 / Practical 1

## Learning Activities

For this practical i had to refresh my HTML and CSS skills, which took me a while. I also had the pleasure of learning
github again, which took be too much time.   
The main event was setting up a basic website for a potentional startup
company called FreshBasket.

## Estimated Hours

5 hours with a lot of frustration in between

## Content Insights

HTML is about being creative and making it your own. By getting the base/core layout of the site from ChatGPT, I
provided a personal touch by changing fonts, sizes, alignments and other details.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Getting a refresher for HTML and CSS was nice, and finally managing to publish the website on github was satisfying.  
I realise that I am not consistent when it comes to technical thinking, unless I continously feed my brain with it.  
I can get easily frustrated about stupid things, so I should learn to either take breaks instead of doing everything in
one sitting, or improving my skills so I won't get frustrated. The best solution is obviously a combination of both.  
In other words, I need to put more time into this subject going forward to ensure a "happy ending".
