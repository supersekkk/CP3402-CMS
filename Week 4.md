## Week

Week 4 (P3) / WordPress CMS & Group Interviews

## Learning Activities

I continued getting familiar with WordPress by adding some plugins for my own and users experience, and making the site work
correctly with respective links and other visual changes to the site

We performed group interviews in practical class

## Resources/Links
WordPress "Ultimate Member" - plugin

## Estimated Hours

~ 30 minutes of learning time \
~ 20 minutes of interviews

## Content Insights
WordPress is a great tool if the user don't have the necessary skills to perform complicated tasks through html, css or javascript. If I want a more customisable website, I
need to download plugins for that specific purpose and learn that plugin instead.

Group, or speed-interviews can be an effective way to get through many subjects in a short amount of time

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

For each plugin I downloaded, there is new material to learn. The learning curve is therefore only limited to how
complex I would like my website to be.

A speed interview is only effective if you use it well. You need to know what you want to know about the person before
you go into the interview. You are very limited with time, so finding the necessary information in such a short time can
be challenging
