## Content Insights
VVV integrates WordPress into your virtual machine, making the experience the same as if you would do it in the browser through a web server.
Using a virtual machine was not a new thing for me, but I think combining it with GitBash, WordPress and FTP's(Filezilla) made the experience overwhelming.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I expected the experience to be more advanced than it really was, and ended up spending an huge amount of time trying to do something I never needed to in the first place. I kept thinking I had a problem, but it turnes out that the solution was right in front of me the whole time. I have to learn to take a step back and get a different perspective for future issues that arise.
