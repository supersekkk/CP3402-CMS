## Estimated Hours
I spent around 3 hours trying to figure out Joomla, and about 1 hour playing around with what i learned.

## Content Insights
Joomla was frustrating, and I still don't understand it fully. I think if I can understand it fully, it can be a great tool for creating content.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Joomla goes much deeper than i thought at first. For further insights, I should practice changing my previously created HTML and CSS layout versus creating a website from scratch. I need to work out how to properly add custom templates / HTML / CSS, perhaps without the use of Helix.
